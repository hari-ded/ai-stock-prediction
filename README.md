# Cracking the Market Code with AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction

This project uses time series analysis and machine learning models like LSTM and Linear Regression to predict future stock prices using historical data.

## 📊 Features
- Data collected using yfinance
- EDA and moving average analysis
- Feature engineering (lag, MA)
- Model comparison (Linear vs LSTM)
- Result visualization

## 📁 Structure
- `/data`: stock data files
- `/notebooks`: EDA and model training
- `/images`: plots and charts
- `requirements.txt`: required libraries

## 🚀 Tools Used
Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
